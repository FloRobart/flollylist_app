# Production image of the FlollyList web application.
# Base images are pinned by digest so that a compromised tag cannot silently change the build.
# Pulling from dhi.io requires "docker login dhi.io" with a Docker Hub account.

# Every FROM line names its image in full, without ARG: Dependabot does not read images
# declared through ARG, and it updates identical FROM lines together in the same pull request.

# Step 1: Extract the Flutter version declared in pubspec.yaml
# This stage is isolated so that bumping "version:" in pubspec.yaml keeps the Flutter layers cached
